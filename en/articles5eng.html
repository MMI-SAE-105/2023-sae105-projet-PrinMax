        <h1 class="texte">"The Shaft": A Melody
        of anxiousness</h1>

        <p class="texte">This music is a composition that inspires
        anxiety and oppression, corresponding
        perfectly to the atmosphere of the film.</p>
        <img src="/public/img/articles 5 1.webp" alt="alien" width=100%>
        <legend><h5 class="texte">The alien making its appearance.</h5></legend>

        <p class="texte">Music serves to reinforce the horror
        psychological and tension that reign all over the
        history as well as delving into the
        spectators in the vision of horror and fear that
        provides this creature.
        It is introduced at the beginning of the film, when
        the crew of the spacecraft Nostromo
        discovers an unknown signal from a
        distant planet. Music evokes
        immediately a sense of concern and
        suspense, leaving the spectators wondering
        what awaits them. "The Shaft" intensifies as
        and as the crew descended onto the
        planet and explore the mysteries of the strange
        spacecraft discovered, marking the
        beginning of the horror that awaits them.
        One of the most striking aspects of
        "The Shaft" is its use to represent
        the Alien himself. The musical theme accompanies
        each appearance of the creature, creating a
        indelible association between melody and
        terror inspired by the Alien. Dissonances and
        subtle crescendos in music emphasize
        the unpredictability and dangerousness of the creature,
        creating a sense of horror and
        each meeting.</p>

        <h2 class="texte">Jerry Goldsmith’s Composition:</h2>

        <p class="texte">Jerry Goldsmith, famous composer born on 10
        February 1929 in Los Angeles and died July 21
        2004 in Beverly Hills, created a musical score
        which combines orchestral elements and
        electronic to strengthen the atmosphere
        terrifying film. The combination of strings
        shrill, oppressive brass and effects
        made "The Shaft" a work capable of
        thrill the viewer.</p>

        <h2 class="texte">The Legacy of "The Shaft":</h2></p>

        <p class="texte">"The Shaft" has become an iconic track
        from the Alien soundtrack, and it has been reprinted and
        reinterpreted in many suites and
        adaptations of the franchise. The impact of this
        musical composition on horror cinema
        is great, it has influenced many others
        composers and directors in the creation of
        soundtracks capable of arousing fear and
        spectator suspense.</p>

        <h2 class="texte">In conclusion:</h2>

        <p class="texte">Music is an essential element of
        the film experience, and "The Shaft"
        by Jerry Goldsmith in "Alien, the 8th Passenger"
        is a remarkable example of his power.
        This disturbing melody contributed in such a way
        significant to the film’s mood and status
        of science fiction horror classics.
        It is a reminder that music can also be
        terrifying and memorable as the images on screen.</p>
